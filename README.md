# Lloyds Sample Weather App
This is a simple weather application that allows users to enter a city name and fetch the current weather information. The app utilizes the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data, including temperature, weather description, and an icon representing the current weather conditions.

The app is built using SwiftUI and follows the MVVM architecture. The weather data is fetched asynchronously and displayed in a card view with a clean and user-friendly interface.

Features:
* Input city name to fetch weather data.
* Display temperature, weather description, and an icon.
* Handle missing or incorrect data gracefully by showing appropriate error messages.
* The app is fully tested, including unit tests to verify the core functionality of the WeatherViewModel and the WeatherService.
  
  *Note: Currently, there are no UI tests included in the project.*

Feel free to modify it further as per your requirements!
